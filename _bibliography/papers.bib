  abstract = {Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is a behavioral phenotype characterized by excessive daydreaming that is frequently present in children with ADHD. This study examined functional connectivity in children with ADHD and high SCT, children with ADHD and low SCT, and typically developing children. Resting state fMRI data were acquired and analyzed to examine group differences as well as associations with ordinal ADHD and SCT symptom scores. Three a priori seeds were generated from NeuroSynth to investigate connectivity patterns associated with default mode, attention, and orienting domains. SCT scores were negatively associated with connectivity between attentional and medial visual areas.},
