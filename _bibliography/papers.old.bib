                       Objective
                       Despite rapid advancements in our understanding of cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS), less is known about the neural correlates of CDS. The objective was to examine associations between childrenâ€™s CDS symptom severity and connectivity within and between specific brain networks.
                       Method
                       Sixty-five right-handed children (ages 8-13 years; 36 boys) with the full continuum of CDS symptom severity were recruited from the community. As part of a cross-sectional descriptive study investigating CDS, children underwent 10-minute resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Connectivity metrics were extracted from the default mode network (DMN) and ventral and dorsal attention networks. Parents and teachers completed measures of CDS and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder inattention (ADHD-IN) symptoms. Multivariate parametric cluster analyses were performed on within- and between-network connections of the specified networks, with age and sex included as covariates. Separate models were conducted with and without controlling for ADHD-IN symptom severity.
                       Results
                       Parent-rated CDS symptom severity was not significantly associated with any between- or within-networks associations of interest. When ADHD-IN symptom severity was included in the model, teacher-rated CDS symptom severity was associated with greater functional connectivity between several regions of the DMN and ventral attention network.
                       Conclusion
                       This study builds on theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting atypical connectivity between task positive and task negative networks as potentially key for understanding the neural correlates of CDS. These findings are important for building a neuroscience-based understanding of CDS and support emerging theoretical models linking CDS to mind wandering as well as DMN-related dysfunction.}
