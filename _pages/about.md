I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) (Aug 2022 -- Present), advised by [Yifan Sun, Ph.D](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/yifansun). My primary research interests focus on the explainability of machine learning models, aiming to develop methods that make complex algorithms more interpretable and transparent.

I obtained my B.S. in Chemistry and Mathematics from the University of Kansas, and my M.S. in Neuroimaging and Informatics at the University of Southern California. 

During my first two years at Stony Brook University, I served as a Teaching Assistant for courses such as IAE 101 (Digital Intelligence Arts & Engineering), CSE 215 (Foundations of Computer Science), and CSE/AMS 547 (Discrete Mathematics). I am also actively involved in mentoring through the Community of Student Mentors (CSM) via the Center for Inclusive Education (CIE) and the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at Stony Brook. Mentoring has been a rewarding way to support fellow students and contribute to an inclusive academic community.

I am honored to be a recipient of the 2024 [NDSEG](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/NDSEG/about/) (National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate) Fellowship, which supports my ongoing research endeavors. My publications and conference presentations can be found [here](publications).

Outside of academia, I participate in USA Weightlifting-sponsored events and am an avid fan of the sport. I also enjoy cooking large quantities of food and hiking in my free time.
